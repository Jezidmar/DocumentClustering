# DocumentClustering task using NMF method and K-Means.


ACQ dataset from official R collection. 

Implementation is inspired by paper: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/hcc/courseSP05/lecs/lec14/NMF03.pdf



Dataset is selected so there is no clear difference between articles. We took 50 of them and examined consistency of clustering and based on that did our decision
We use Frobenius norm as default metric of distance. In the pptx file, we did a comparison with the Kulback Leibler divergence method too.

#TODO translate all to english.
